# Linux Mint System Maintenance

Can be used with any distro in theory, but the script needs to be able to make a Timeshift ( preinstalled on Linux Mint ) snapshot before it will do anything.

Handles updates for Apt and Flatpak, also does a quick cleanup of unused depenadancies with user-friendly messages along the way.

Perfect for running once a week or so.
